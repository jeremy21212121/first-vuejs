#A basic to-do List
##My first VueJS project
I loosely followed the instructions at https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/, but I wanted to figure things out myself so I did it my own way.

I have found VueJS to be super intuitive so far. My last framework experience was with Angular 1.X and it was mind-numbing trying to actually understand what I was doing.

I struggled most with making the delete buttons work. Until I figured out how to pass in the index in a v-for directive.

Loosely following the tutorial, I already have a very basic understanding of VueJS and it just seems to click. I'm excited and encouraged to learn more.

The error messages have been incredibly helpful in figuring out what I was doing wrong. And the official docs are very approachable.
